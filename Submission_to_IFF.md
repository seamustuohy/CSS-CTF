## Who is this session for?

_Describe the target audience for this session. Who would you like to see in the room? Who would benefit the most from your session?_ 

This session is for people who are interested in developing the skills required to provide direct security support for civil society actors or more effectively coordinate with those who do.  Existing members of the “security for civil society” community should find the challenges entertaining, and are welcome to participate but are not the target audience. The people who will gain the most from this event are individuals who do not provide security support in their daily work but would be interested in learning some discrete skills that will allow them to respond when the need arises or who are just starting to provide security support but do not have substantial experience doing so. 

## What outcomes do you envision for this session?

The outcome of the CSS-CTF should be an increase of critical information security skills among civil society members. That said, the goal of the CTF is for the players to learn and have fun! The point of a problem is to be solved, so most problems will be able to be solved by any possible participant who goes to the “help center” to seek assistance.  Success for this event would mean that every problem is solved by at least one team of non-expert participants.

Civil Society Actors have gained security support  skills and comfort working collaboratively with others in the space. 

Security support skills include: 
Responding to an incident
Writing a report 
How to share limited information
Basic Forensics

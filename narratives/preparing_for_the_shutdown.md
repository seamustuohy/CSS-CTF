# Somethings coming. I don't know what it is, but it is gonna be bad


## Narrative
- Contacted by a concerned civil society member about concerns of censorship around an upcoming election/event.
- The civil society member says that censorship has happened in the past. They didn't keep track of previous incidents. Tthey don't know what may happen.


## Puzzles
- accurately identify the type of censorship that is likely to take place in a country using historic incidents and OSINT
- Find an expert on censorship in that country who is at IFF and reach out to them. This will also encourage participants to connect to other local experts there or to seek out non-attending experts who can help them in the future. (We should ID attending folks early and make sure they are on board. We should also make sure we treat them really nice or buy them a present for the work they do on the day or two when they are tracked down by every CTF participant.)

# How to prepare for the storm

## Narrative
- They want your help in identifying what they should do
  - possible tactics and technologies they can implement
  - preparations they, and their community, should take before and during possible censorship.

## Puzzles
- Identify techniques that could work to accomplish specific goals of the group/community who is reaching out to you
  - could be about communicating what is happening with the world
  - could be about ensuring communication around what is happening withing the country
- Develop a backup plan for the community member

# Don't go it alone

## Narrative
- They don't have the technical capabilities (or interest) in doing the technical aspects of preparation but they do want to make sure they are prepared when it happens.

## Puzzles
- id where to get support needed to carry it out (set up proxies, conduct network testing, build guidance material for local actors, translate existing guidance material.)

# Something borrowed makes them blue.

## Narrative
- You get a message delivered to you that the government has invested in technology used by one of their neighboring countries that allows them to conduct an unexpected type of censorship. They want your help in responding to this unexpected event.

## Puzzles
- Help them figure out what is happening
  - based on the little bits of information that is available,
  - help them collect information that is needed to confirm your hypothesis
- help identify how to respond
  - come up with the solution themselves
  - connect them to rapid response folks and experts

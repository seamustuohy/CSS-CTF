## What is a CTF

Capture the Flag is a set of security puzzles, sometimes tied together with a narrative, that people try to solve either individually or in teams to gain points, and the person or team with the most points at the end of the competition wins. Points are gained through finding "flags," or specific pieces of information. CTFs are fairly common at security conferences or as stand alone events. While they are competitions, the real goal is to facilitate learning and skill development. 

## Why would CSS benefit from one at IFF

The CTF is a fun way for people at IFF, regardless of starting technical ability both to learn or practice technical skills and to practice working together. Many organizations have at most one security person meaning that 

The outcome of the CSS-CTF should be an increase of critical information security skills among civil society members. That said, the goal of the CTF is for the players to learn and have fun! The point of a problem is to be solved, so most problems should be solved by any participant who takes a training and success would mean that every problem is solved by at least one team.

## What will this practically look like

This competition will involve multiple categories of problems, each of which contains a variety of challenges of different point values and difficulties. Teams attempt to earn the most points by completing the tasks correctly. Rather than a race, this style of game play encourages taking time to approach challenges and prioritizes quantity and quality of correct submissions over the timing.

Participant "teams" can involve one or more people, working alone or on a team, who attempt to "capture flags."


## How to participate

Participants sign up with a team on any day.

You can participate in as many or as few competitions as you want. We will also leave up some of the puzzles afterward with answers so that people who did not participate during the event will be able to learn from what we put together.
